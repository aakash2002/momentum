# MVP Feature List
## Authentication
- [ ] Authenticate with Supabase DB
- [ ] Once logged in, see how to not prompt login every time unless user logged out. See if some local file needs to be saved or not.

## AI Task Breakdown
- [ ] Fix why Gemini 1.5 flash doesnt breakdown all tasks and skips first task in the instruction. Eg: I want to make twitter post about progress of my startup idea, do some office work for an hour and write the report for my paper. I have done abstract and background work and have the rest left. I have about 4 hours of work time available.

Here it skips twitter.

- [ ] Use OpenAI model later (a cheaper one ideally)
